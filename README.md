PortHound is a lightweight port scanning tool designed for network administrators and security professionals. It is designed to quickly identify open ports and       services on remote hosts, allowing users to detect potential security vulnerabilities and harden their network defenses.
  
# Usage

To use PortHound, simply specify the target host and the range of ports to scan. For example:

Build it into an exe using Pyinstaller --onefile PortScan.py or execute via command line python3 PortScan.py.

Or use the CLI version, which can be executed like so: python3 PortScan-CLI.py IP_ADDRESS START_PORT END_PORT
